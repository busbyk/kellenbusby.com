- [ ] Revalidation!
- [ ] Create Turso db for previews - move to github workflows for CI probably
- [ ] Change the posts sitemap to just a single site-wide sitemap, include tags pages in it

- [ ] Add live preview
- [ ] Custom 404 page
- [ ] Error boundary
- [ ] Global loading indicator
- [ ] Migrate baileys traverse POC + map component(s)
- [ ] It would be sick to have my profile links move from mid screen to the footer on scroll. This means also having a longer scrolling landing page.
- [ ] Pagination functionality for blog (once I have enough content for that to matter)

- [ ] Create a custom theme for the Tailwind typography plugin that matches my theme
- [ ] Debug upload type issues
      blob storage is setup but a few things are weird: when you crop it, the link still goes to the original photo (i.e. clicking the filename); and when you first upload a photo, the image appears broken/unloaded after upload completes. Strange.
