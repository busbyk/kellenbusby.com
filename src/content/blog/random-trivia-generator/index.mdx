The Random Trivia Generator client came to me looking for a new feature for an existing application. The client had worked with several developers in the past and the application stack, infrastructure, and tech used was only partially understood. Since the client wasn't entirely sure what they had we agreed that including my [Web Application Discovery service](https://www.kellenbusby.com/software#:~:text=Web%20Application%20Discovery) would be worth it.

I added dynamic single question pages, fully documented the functionality of the existing app in detail, and wrote READMEs and technical docs.

### [Single Question Pages](https://www.randomtriviagenerator.com/question/after-his-death-in-a-1998-skiing-accident-what-famous-song-title-was-placed-on-sonny-bono-s-headstone-1)

## This discovery work led to subsequent projects including:

- Migrating their deprecated Strapi v3 backend including a migration from a MongoDB database to a PostgreSQL database
- Bugfixes
- Pre-built playable quizzes (admin CRDU functionality for the client in Strapi)
- Automated generation of wrong answers using OpenAI API

### [Playable Quizzes](https://www.randomtriviagenerator.com/quizzes)

Working with Random Trivia Generator has been a great client relationship and I look forward to continuing to work with them in the future.
