Cardonomics is, at it's core, a credit card sub affiliate marketing platform. Cardonomics.com is a full-featured content site but includes branded pages for Cardonomics creators. The Cardonomics web app allows creators to manage their branded pages, view analytics, manage links and embeds, and receive payouts via Stripe Connect.

Over the past two years I've worked closely with the client as the solo dev to architect, build, maintain, and iterate upon Cardonomics. This is an ongoing client relationship with new features in the works.

## Main features:

- Public content site at [cardonomics.com](http://cardonomics.com)
- Creator affiliate tracking system with persistent attribution, reporting partner integrations, and complete payouts system using Stripe connect
- Creator branded pages for driving traffic from related content, customizable in the Cardonomics web app
- Analytics and payouts in the Cardonomics web app
  - Branded page web analytics
  - Sales
- Embeddable widgets

## Tech:

- Remix.run
- React
- Strapi CMS
- Typescript
- TailwindCSS

## Deployed on:

- Vercel

## Additional integrations:

- Three third-party media networks' content and reporting APIs
- Stripe Connect
- Algolia (custom built Strapi plugin)
- Amazon SES
- Amazon S3
- Plausible Analytics
- Sentry
