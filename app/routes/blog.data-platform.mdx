**Note:** I'm limited in what I can share about this project due to NDAs.

This project represents a long-term relationship with a client where we iterated on the product over time.

I architected and built this MERN stack app from scratch based on designs provided by the client. In later versions I built out a data warehouse system using AWS Glue and Amazon Athena to provide quick access to large datasets for users.

The core feature is a complex drag and drop audience builder with conditional logic that allows a user to build a custom audience using over 200 attribute filters, previously purchased audiences, and uploaded audiences. They can then download large audiences within seconds after purchasing when it previously took engaging a data scientist directly.

## Features:

- Complex audience builder with drag & drop, attribute search, async builds
- Custom-built user management with basic permissions system and admin panel
- Complete e-commerce Stripe integration (product purchases, subscriptions, invoices)
- MongoDB using Mongoose
- AWS Glue and Amazon Athena for big data processing and access
- SendGrid integration
- Job scheduling system
- ActiveCampaign integration
- Intercom integration
- S3 for multi-part image uploads and presigned urls for secure purchase downloads

## Deployed on:

- AWS Elastic Beanstalk using Docker Compose
- MongoDB Atlas for DB hosting
