              <p>
                I'm a stoked, driven, adventurous, and curious person. There are
                three major facets to me. There is the outdoor enthusiast,
                adventure-driven part of me that loves to ski, mountain bike,
                climb, run, backpack, and travel. There is the curious, maker
                part of me that loves to develop software (particularly web
                applications), build things, and try new hobbies. I especially
                like woodworking. The third part of me pervades the other two: a
                passion for life design.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm intentional about how I spend my time and what's important
                in my life. I work towards long-term goals and build flexibility
                and joy into my life on a daily basis. Work is part of my life
                because I like what I do and I get to help other people achieve
                their dreams, their goals. Life design is about yourself and
                others.

                I lived in my van for over 4 years, traveling the country
                climbing, skiing, biking, hiking, and working as a freelance
                software engineer. Now I'm living in Bellingham, Washington and
                enjoying all that the PNW has to offer while still traveling a
                lot.
