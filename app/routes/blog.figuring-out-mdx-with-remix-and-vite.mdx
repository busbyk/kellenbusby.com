# {frontmatter.title}

There's a lot I don't know about MDX. I've been aware of it for a long time and generally understand what it is but I've never set it up before. Let's figure it out.

## OK here's what I want to know:

- What's the difference between MDX transformed at build time vs. transformed at run time (and is transformed the right term here)?
- How to get appropriate syntax highlighting in mdx files including handling component imports? Can I get tsconfig paths (i.e. ~/components style imports) to work? What are those called again?
- How can I get hot module reloading to work on my mdx files? run time transformation but how do I do that and what are the tradeoffs?
- Where does the mdx-bundler package come in? I read that it doesn't work in serverless environments.
- What is a Unified pipeline? I'm gathering that it is the customized pipeline of transforming markdown into html but I need to know more.
  [unified](https://unifiedjs.com/explore/package/unified/) -- lets you inspect and transform content with plugins
  unified.js seems to be the underlying engine. It's an interface for turning content into structured data which can be converted to other formats. Seems heavily plugin focused.
- What is rehype and remark [Plugins]?
  rehype is an ecosystem of plugins (related to unified.js, I think made by them) that works with transforming HTML specifically
  remark is the same thing but for markdown specifically

## The solution I want:

- Essentially what I get with [remix-blog-mdx](https://github.com/pcattori/remix-blog-mdx/tree/main) but with HMR
- Syntax highlighting
- Intellisense importing of components in mdx files
- Dope VS Code plugins that will make writing markdown in .mdx files really nice

## What I've learned so far:

Using `@mdx-js/rollup` is great right out of the box and I think I may just stick with this in the short term. The only thing I really don't like about it is the lack of HMR which honestly kind of feels like a bug. If I could figure that out I'd probably stop right there.

The issue with this approach is that the mdx is compiled to html at build time which would end up being a scaling problem eventually. I don't personally think I'm going to run into that with kellenbusby.com but I like to consider these things so that if I want to re-use code for a larger project/client project I can and not have to worry about scaling. This is partly a learning experience after all.

The `vite-plugin-markdown` approach that https://bradgarropy.com/ took is pretty sweet in that it gives more control over transformation of the markdown and I think it at least partially resolves the scaling issues. It gets HMR. But it doesn't allow for MDX (no components in markdown content). I want MDX.

The last step is to use mdx-bundler to take a similar approach to https://bradgarropy.com/ but get to use MDX. The big issues I foresee here is that there are a couple GH issues indicating that `mdx-bundler` doesn't work in serverles environments and I deploy to Vercel. So I need to figure out if that's going to be an issue.
